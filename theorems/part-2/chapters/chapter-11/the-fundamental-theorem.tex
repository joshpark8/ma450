\section{The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups]
	Every finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order. Moreover, the number of terms in the product and the orders of the cyclic groups are uniquely determined by the group.
\end{theorem}
