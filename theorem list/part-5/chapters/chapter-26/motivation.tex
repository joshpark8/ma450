\section{Motivation}

\begin{remark}
	In this chapter, we present a convenient way to define a group with certain prescribed properties. Simply put, we begin with a set of elements that we want to generate the group, and a set of equations (called \textit{relations}) that specify the conditions that these generators are to satisfy. Among all such possible groups, we will select one that is as large as possible. This will uniquely determine the group up to isomorphism.
