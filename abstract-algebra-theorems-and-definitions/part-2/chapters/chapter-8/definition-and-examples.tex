\begin{definition}[External Direct Product]
	Let $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_n$ be a finite collection of groups. The \textit{external direct product} of $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_n$, written as $G_1 \oplus G_2 \oplus \dots \oplus G_n$, is the set of all $n$-tuples for which the $i$th component is an element of $G_i$ and the operation is componentwise.
